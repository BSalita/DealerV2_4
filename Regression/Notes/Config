This is the directory Regression/Notes 
The .dli files in the Regression directory all have a seed cmd in them; the seed number is typically a prime.
The primes can be got from the ~/Programming/Perl5/Testing/primes_list.pl


To find out the seeds type the cmd: (which will sort in increasing seed order)
grep seed *.dli | sort  -k 2.1 -g
as of 2024/06/22 the highest seed in use is:  313 which is the 65th prime


There is also a script that will check the .out  files in the Regression/Output/ directory vs the .ref files in the Refer sub-directory.
The files that begin with HOW2 cannot be run in batch mode. 
They are files that illustrate scripting a dealer file with parms passed in on the command line.
List the file(s) for an example of how to use them.
See the file, "README_HOW2.txt" for more details.
