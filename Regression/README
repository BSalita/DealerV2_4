This is the directory Regression 

The Dealer Input files (suffix .dli) in this directory all have a seed cmd in them; 
the seed number is typically a prime.
The primes can be got from the ./Code/files_mod.pl
The Makefile will run scripts in the current directory
a) create files with suffix .dlo in the Output sub-directory by running the test version of dealerv2 on the .dli|.dls|.dlt|.dlx file(s)
b) create files with suffix .ref in the Refer  sub-directory by 
    first overwriting  the .dlo files in the Output directory by running the production version of dealerv2 on the .dli|.dls|.dlt|.dlx file(s)
    copy-ing the new Output/*.dlo files to Refer/*.ref 
c) check the .dlo files vs the .ref files for differences. 

the "make all" target does the steps (b) (a) (c) in that order.
other targets are:
showme      displays the various makefile variables and the versison of whatever dealerv2 is to be run
clean       deletes all the files in Output
dli         runs dealer on all the .dli and .dlt files
dls         runs dealer on all the .dls and .dlx files
check_stats runs the dealer | fmt pipleline that checks dealer's generated stats for distribution and hcp vs the theoretical ones
dlo_to_ref  makes a copy of the .dlo files in Output in  the Refer directory renaming the suffix to .ref
cmp_refer   runs the diff command comparing Output/*.dlo to Refer/*.ref
