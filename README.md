# Dealer-Version-2_4
Expanded Functionality for Bridge Dealer Program (Dealer Vers 1 used by BBO)
This version uses GCC / g++ version 11.4 versions of the DDS librarie(s). and needs gcc version 11.4 to rebuild.
It replaces the older Dealer-Version-2- which uses the obsolete gcc version 7.x

of Dealer in general and Version 2 in particular.
