# ---- JGM has received the following note from a user: ---------------------
I have also successfully built it on WSL (UBuntu)
       ^^^^

I installed a clean WSL2

Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 x86_64)

and to build dealerv2 I only had to install

bison and flex

then 

git clone https://github.com/dealerv2/DealerV2_4



JGM adds the following:
This clone command will create a copy of the repo on github in the sub directory
DealerV2_4 in your current (probably your home) directory.

If you want to build your own version of dealer, then after installing the 
necessary tools, (bison, flex, and perhaps m4) then:

a) To build a version with no debugging code installed
    cd Prod
    make
    
b) To build a version with the Debugging code installed
    cd Debug
    make
    
Note that these commands will overwrite the current binaries in these 
directories (Prod, Debug), but there are copies of the binaries in the bin 
directory that you can use if the new ones you tried to build do not work.

If you intend to make extensive mods to the code then I recommend that
a) you use "git" to track your changes and manage your revisions.
b) you execute the file "install_dealer.bash"
   to create a complete dealerv2 environment in the /usr/local/games
   portion of the linux filesystem.
   That way you can use the tools in the Regression directory to see if your
   modified version of dealerv2 has broken any existing features.
